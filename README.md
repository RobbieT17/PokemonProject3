# Pokemon Battle Simulator

## Overview
Greetings! This is a passion project of mine I've been working on throughout my college degree. I take the concepts I've learned in my coding classes and applied them into this project. I started this project Spring 2023 (My freshmen year) as an assignment for one of my classes. I loved working on the project so I decided to continue it on my own.

## Goal
The end goal of this project to have a nice UI design (using JavaFX) and an online battle system where you can challenge your friends to a match. You'll be able to create and save your own pokemon teams.

## Progress
I have the basics of the battle system working, it can be run in the terminal. It's still in the testing phase: No online multiplayer, teams are preset. I'm currently working on the UI design. I want people to be able to clone this repository and be able to run this program on their local machine without having to worry about any JavaFX dependacny. I've used maven to handle this, but I don't know how maven works too well so there may be problems getting the JavaFX page to display. Running the battle in the terminal work though!

## How to Run
Make sure your Java is 23.
There are three applications you can run:

- **Start a Battle**: Run `Battle.java`, located in directory `src/main/java/project/battle`
- **Type Matchup Calculator**: Run `TypeMatchCalculator`, located in directory `src/main/java/project/application`
- **Load JavaFX application**: Run `App`, located in `src/main/java/project/application`
